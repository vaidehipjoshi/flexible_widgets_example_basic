# flexible_widgets_example_basic

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Flexible widget :
fit:flexFit.tight
Please note that it only takes as much space as fits in there without squeezing any items off the screen
Child force to fill available space while using flexfit.tight, even if we try to set fix width which is less to occupy the screen then using flexfit.tight it occupies full width
If we use flexfit.tight for multiple widgets then flexible divide it in to equal space
Expanded is widget used for replacement of flexfit.tight
